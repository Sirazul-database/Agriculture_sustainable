        <h1>What is Food Security?</h1>
        <p>
            Food security means having, at all times, both physical and economic access to sufficient food to meet
            dietary needs for a productive and healthy life. A family is food secure when its members do not live in
            hunger or fear of hunger. Food insecurity is often rooted in poverty and has long-term impacts on the
            ability of families, communities and countries to develop and prosper. Prolonged undernourishment stunts
            growth, slows cognitive development and increases susceptibility to illness.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>oday, more than 800 million people across the globe go to bed hungry every night, most of them smallholder
            farmers who depend on agriculture to make a living and feed their families. Despite an explosion in the
            growth of urban slums over the last decade, nearly 75 percent of poor people in developing countries live in
            rural areas. Growth in the agriculture sector -- from farm to fork -- has been shown to be at least twice as
            effective in reducing poverty as growth in other sectors.</p>

        <p>
            Investing in these smallholder farmers—many of whom are women—and the food systems that nourish them is more
            important than ever. In order to feed a population expected to grow to 9 billion people by 2050, the world
            will have to double its current food production. Given scarcity of natural resources and other challenges,
            the world will need to be more efficient in how it meets this demand. To ensure that people have sufficient
            food, aligning short-term assistance with a long-term development strategy can help countries feed their own
            people.
